This is a Codecademy project that teaches you how to create a web app that uses Spotify API to create playlists. It has a few steps to guide you, and gives you the opportunity to learn how to create components, how to comunicate them with each other, and how to make request from an API. Then I added a little functionality to remove a track from the search list when it is added to de playlist, and vice versa.


It was created using React.
